# OutPassRequests Mobile Centering Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Summary
Outpass requests were moving and not staying centered on mobile devices due to unstable CSS positioning in the responsive layout.

## Root Cause
The mobile layout (≤768px) used `padding-left: 50%` combined with `text-align: right` which created inconsistent positioning that caused content to move around.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Replaced unstable positioning**: Changed from `padding-left: 50%` and `text-align: right` to stable flexbox layout
2. **Improved card layout**: Used `display: flex` with `justify-content: space-between` for consistent centering
3. **Fixed label positioning**: Changed from absolute positioning to static positioning with `margin-right: auto`
4. **Added content handling**: Used `::after` pseudo-element to display actual content with proper text overflow handling
5. **Enhanced button layout**: Special handling for action buttons with proper flex-direction and spacing

### Technical Changes Made:
- **Mobile layout**: Now uses flexbox for stable centering
- **Labels**: Positioned statically to prevent movement
- **Content**: Properly contained with max-width and text-overflow
- **Action buttons**: Handled separately with column layout
- **Spacing**: All spacing uses responsive clamp() functions for consistency

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/OutPassRequests.css` - Updated mobile responsive layout

## Testing Status
✅ **Implementation Complete** - Ready for testing across different mobile screen sizes

### Recommended Testing:
- Test on different mobile screen sizes (320px, 375px, 414px, 768px)
- Verify content stays centered and doesn't move
- Check that all interactive elements work
- Test scrolling behavior
- Verify button interactions (Approve/Reject) work properly

The mobile layout should now remain stable and centered without any movement issues.
